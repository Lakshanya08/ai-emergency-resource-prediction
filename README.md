# 🚑 AI Emergency Detection Dashboard

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Manual monitoring of patient vitals can be slow and error-prone.  
Delayed detection of critical health conditions may lead to severe consequences.  

There is a need for a real-time system that can:
- Monitor vital signs
- Detect emergency conditions instantly
- Assist in emergency preparedness

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

AI Emergency Detection Dashboard is a web-based healthcare monitoring system that:

- Accepts vital inputs (Heart Rate, Oxygen Level, Temperature, Age)
- Detects emergency conditions using threshold logic
- Displays dynamic visual alerts
- Predicts emergency resource demand using Machine Learning
